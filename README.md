# Mixed Reality Tank Commander
A BEng (2019) thesis project, emulating a Mixed Reality game of closed arena dog fights mirrored in Unity Game Engine using a 360-degree camera, image processing TensorFlow and targets reconstruction through a focal length of the lens.
The communication between the game and reality is handled through an FFMPEG video stream and PyZQT socket library as a control command exchange.

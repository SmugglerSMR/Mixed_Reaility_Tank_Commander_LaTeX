\chapter{Research Progress \& Results}
Following the previous section, this part is dedicated to reporting the progress of implementation by splitting into four stages of work.
The reasons behind the structure are to create consistent in the most relevant information without repeating the same topic.
They meant to create a proper way of describing the workflow and bring a better understanding of the task in hand.
They summarise findings and achievements upon expansion and modification based on discoveries and implementations in the future.

    \item \textit{Testing}

Also, it aimed to present current findings and missing components that are left for investigation. \\
The Software Developer experience tells that to finish project successfully, it meant to be divided into Agile phases of development.

\subsection{Testing}
Since the actual tank model was damaged and remained in a disassembled state, the project required other manners to test functionality.
\subsubsection{Testing Environment}
The Engineering Laboratory at QUT S block Level 9 had such a testing area for robotics students.
It is a small surrounding area with a field of 2 by 2 meters.
By printing a few images of the tank and sticking them to the walls or portable paper points, this testing area may create a sufficient environment.
The idea was to record a testing video with a 360-degree camera and move it manually around the testing area, as well as targets.
This way, at least some kind of action will be used within the simulation.\\[1pt]
\subsubsection{Simulating Tank Movement}
In order to test how the controller behaves with Unity, a small testing circuit with a straightforward Python script was developed within SPB.
Figure~\ref{fig:circuit} below represents a very simple circuit for Flashing LED upon calls through \textit{RPi.GPIO} Library.
Each LED represents one of the directions of the movement, if LED flashes, means tank successfully on the move.
At any point, the user, through console commands, is able to simulate an obstacle, informing that the tank has reached a limit of the arena and should not go any further.

\subsubsection{Results}
As a result, a prerecorded video, wirelessly connected Python controller, and HTC Gear create a reasonably reliable simulation within Unity Game Engine.
The recording of game functionality, ML detection and socket communication was demonstrated on video to the supervisor and will appear in the Final presentation. 
All Software details will be discussed in the next Prototype section. 
\subsection{Documentation of Development}
The final goal of everything is to bring usage for other users and researchers.
The aim is to set up proper instructions for every part which the project consists of.
So far, there is a Faster-RCNN architecture that was used to create models for Machine Learning.
The following link refers to Git Repository projects which are used over TensorFlow usage~\cite{smugglersmr_repository_2018}.\\
The document also consists of additional instructions for TensorFlow installation and FFmpeg manipulation, presented in this report above.

All non-relative code or script can be written by any low-level programmer.
However, they will still be appended to the Appendix for Reference.
